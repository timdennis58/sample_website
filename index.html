  <h1>Tim's Learn Enough Story</h1>
     <p>
    Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to <em><strong>teachtechnical sophistication</strong></em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
    command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
    everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
    Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
    We believe there are<strong>at least a billion people </strong>who can benefit from
    learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

      Michael is the creator of the <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/">
      Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
      introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
      <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
      plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
      are slightly exaggerated.

      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
